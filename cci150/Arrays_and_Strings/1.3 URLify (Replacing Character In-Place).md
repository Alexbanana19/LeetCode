# 1.3 URLify (Replacing Character In-Place)

## Description

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)

```
EXAMPLE
Input:  "Mr John Smith    ", 13
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
```


Hints: #53, # 118



## My Solutions

The solution may first seem trivial in Python as we only needs to replace the spaces with `%20` and then return `s[:true_len]`. However, the `replace` method in Python is not in-place. Let's how we gonna do it.

### 1  Two Scan

A common approach is to first count the number of spaces in the string. By doubling this number, we know how many extra `%20` we need in the final results. Then we work backwards, replace the character with `%20` if it's a whitespace, otherwise we just copy the original character.

```python
def urlify(s, true_len):
	space_count = s.count(' ')
    index = true_len + space_count * 2
    
    for i in range(len(s)-1,-1,-1):
		if s[i] == ' ':
            s[index-1] = '0'
            s[index-2] = '2'
            s[index-3] = '%'
            index -= 3
        else:
            s[index-1] = s[i]
            index -= 1
```
