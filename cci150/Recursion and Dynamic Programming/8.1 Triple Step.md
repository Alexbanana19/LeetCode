```python
def tripleStep(n):
    return tripleStepHelper(n, {})

def tripleStepHelper(n, d):
    if n < 2:
        return max(0,n)
    if n not in d:
        d[n] = tripleStepHelper(n-1, d) \
        	   + tripleStepHelper(n-2, d) \
               + tripleStepHelper(n-3, d)
    return d[n]
        
```



## Solutions from the Book

The same.

Regardless of whether or not you use memoization, note that the number of ways will quickly overflow the bounds of an integer. By the time you get to just `n = 37`, the result has already overflowed. Using a `long` will delay, but not completely solve, this issue.

It is great to communicate this issue to your interviewer. He probably won't ask you to work around it (although you could, with a `BigInteger` class). but it's nice to demonstrate that you think about these issues.
