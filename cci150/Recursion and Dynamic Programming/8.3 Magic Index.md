# 8.3 Magic Index

## Description

Magic Index: A magic index in an array `A[ 1 ... n-1]` is defined to be an index such that `A[i] = i`. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array `A`.

What if the values are not distinct?



## My Solutions

The linear time solution is not good enough as the array has been already sorted. We should try to come up with solution that achieves `O(logn)` time complexity.

The idea is also simple: Similar to binary search, we start from the middle, if the middle value is larger than the index, we go left; otherwise we go right.

```python
def magicIndex(A):
    start = 0
    end = len(A) - 1
    
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if mid == A[mid]:
            return mid
        if mid < A[mid]:
            end = mid - 1
        if mid > A[mid]:
            start = mid + 1
   return -1
```



## Solutions from the Book (Follow Up)

If the elements are not distinct, then the above algorithm fails.

The general pattern is that we compare `midIndex` and `midValue` for equality first. Then, if they are not equal, we recursively search the left and right sides as follows:

- Left side: search indices start through `Math.min (midlndex - 1, midValue)`.
- Right side: search indices `Math.max(midlndex + 1, midValue)` through end.

```python
def magicIndex(A):
    start = 0
    end = len(A) - 1
    
    while start <= end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        if mid == A[mid]:
            return mid
        if mid < A[mid]:
            end = min(mid - 1, A[mid]) ## skipping the impossible indices
        if mid > A[mid]:
            start = max(mid + 1, A[mid])
   return -1
```
