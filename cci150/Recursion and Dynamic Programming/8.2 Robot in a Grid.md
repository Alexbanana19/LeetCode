# 8.2 Robot in a Grid

## Description

Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with `r` rows and `c` columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.



## My Solutions

```python
def findPath(grid):
    path = []
    path = findPathHelper(grid,i,j,path)
	return path

def findPathHelper(grid, i, j, path):
    if i == 0 and j == 0:
        return path + [(i,j)]
    if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 0:
        cand = findPathHelper(grid,i,j-1,path)
       	if len(cand) > 0 and cand[0] == (0,0):
            return cand + [(i,j)]
    if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] != 0:
        cand = findPathHelper(grid,i-1,j,path)
       	if len(cand) > 0 and cand[0] == (0,0):
            return cand + [(i,j)]
    return []
```



## Solutions from the Book

The above solution runs in `O(2^(r+c))` time complexity, since each path has r+c steps and there are two choices we can make at each step.

Often, we can optimize exponential algorithms by finding duplicate work. 

We can cache the visited failed points to avoid repeated visits.

```python
""" This solution is adapted from the book """
def findPath(grid):
    path = []
    cache = {}
    path = findPathHelper(grid,i,j,path, cache)
	return path

def findPathHelper(grid, i, j, path, cache):
    if (i,j) in cache:
        return cache[(i,j)]
    
    if i == 0 and j == 0:
        return path + [(i,j)]
    
    if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 0:
        cand = findPathHelper(grid,i,j-1,path)
       	if len(cand) > 0 and cand[0] == (0,0):
            cache[(i,j)] = cand + [(i,j)]
            return cache[(i,j)]
        
    if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] != 0:
        cand = findPathHelper(grid,i-1,j,path)
       	if len(cand) > 0 and cand[0] == (0,0):
            cache[(i,j)] = cand + [(i,j)]
            return cache[(i,j)]
        
    cache[(i,j)] = []
    return cache[(i,j)]
```

This simple change will make our code run substantially faster. The algorithm will now take `O(rc)` time because we hit each cell just once.
