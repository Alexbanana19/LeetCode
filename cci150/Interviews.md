# Interviews

## Microsoft

- smart people, geeks
- write code on the boards
- Why do you want to work for Microsoft
  - I've been using Microsoft software as long as I can remember, and I'm really impressed at how Microsoft manages to create a product that is universally excellent. For example, I've been using Visual Studio recently to learn game programming, and its APls are excellent



## Amazon

- one or two screening interview
- four or five onsite interview
- "bar raiser" interviewer:
  - brought in from a different team to keep the bar high
  - just because you seem to be struggling more in this interview doesn't mean you're actually doing worse. Your performance is judged relative to other candidates;
- Amazon cares a lot about scale. Make sure you prepare for scalability questions.
- Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object-oriented design.



## Google

- first phone screen
- on-site interview, you'll interview with four to six people
- Your lunch interviewer doesn't submit feedback, so this is a great opportunity
  to ask honest questions.
- Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (**Analytical Ability, Coding,**
  **Experience, and Communication**)
- Google cares about how to design a scalable system. So, make sure you prepare
  for questions from System Design and Scalability.
- Google puts a strong focus on analytical (algorithm) skills, regardless of experience.



## Facebook

- one or two phone screens
- a homework assignment that will include a mix of coding and algorithms. Pay attention to your coding style here.
- Each interviewer is given a "role" during the on-site interviews, which helps ensure that there are no repetitive questions and that they get a holistic picture of a candidate. These roles are:
  - Behavioral ("Jedi"): This interview assesses your ability to be successful in Facebook's environment.
  - Coding and Algorithms ("Ninja"); These are your standard coding and algorithms questions, much like what you'll find in this book.
  - Design/Architecture ("Pirate"): For a backend software engineer, you might be asked system design
    questions.
- They want to know you can hack together an elegant and scalable solution using any language of choice.
