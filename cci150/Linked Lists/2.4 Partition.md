# 2.4 Partition

## Description

Write code to partition a linked list around a value `x`, such that all nodes less than `x` come before all nodes greater than or equal to `x`. If x is contained within the list the values of x only need to be after the elements less than `x` (see below). The partition element `x` can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

EXAMPLE
Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition=5]
Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

## My Solution

### 1 Two Pointers

We just need to shovel the elements that are greater than the key to the head. Done.

```python
def partition(head, val):
   	q = head
    r = head.next
    while r is not None:
    	if r.data < val:
            q.next = r.next
            r.next = head
            head = r
            
            r = q.next
        else:
        	q = r
        	r = r.next
            
```

### 1 Stable Solution

We iterate through the linked list, inserting elements into our before list or our after list. Once we reach the end of the linked list and have completed this splitting, we merge the two lists.

```python
def partition(head, val):
    before_start = before_end = None
    after_start = after_end = None
    
    p = head
    while p is not None:
        nxt = p.next
        p.next = None
        
        if p.data < val:
            if before_start is None:
                before_start = before_end = p
            else:
                before_end.next = p
                before_end = p
        else:
            if after_start is None:
                after_start = after_end = p
            else:
                after_end.next = p
                after_end = p
        p = nxt
        
        if before_start is None:
            return after_start
       	
        berfore_end.next = after_start
        return before_start
                
```
