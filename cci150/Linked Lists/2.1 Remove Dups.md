# 2.1 Remove Dups

# Description

Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

**FOLLOW UP**

How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
Hints: #9, #40



## My Solution

###  1 Hash Table

```python
class Node(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = None
        self.next = None

def removeDup(node):
    d = {}
    p = node.next
    q = node
	while p is not None:
        if p.data in d:
            q.next = p.next
            del p
            p = q
        else:
            d[p.data] = True
            q = p
        p = p.next
```



For followup, I can't think of any solution but iterating through the link list using with two for-loops which has `O(N^2)` time complexity.

## Solutions from the Book

Basically the same as my code.
