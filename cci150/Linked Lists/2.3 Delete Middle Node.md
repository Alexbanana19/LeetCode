# 2.3 Delete Middle Node

# Description

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

```
EXAMPLE
Input:the node c from the linked lista->b->c->d->e->f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e- >f
```

## My Solution

### Two Pointers (Many Problems!)

```python
def delMiddleNode(head):
	fast = slow = head
    while fast is not None:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next
        if fast is not None:
            fast = fast.next
        else:
            break
    return slow
```





## Solutions from the Book

First, the problem specifies that we are only given access to the current node, so we only need to copy the data from the next node over to the current node, then delete the next node.

```python
def delNode(node):
    if node is None or node.next is None: # boundary check
        return False
    nxt = node.next
    node.data = nxt.data
    node.next = nxt.next
    return True
```

Note that this problem cannot be solved if the node to be deleted is the last node in the linked list. That's okay-your interviewer wants you to point that out, and to discuss how to handle this case. You could, for example, consider marking the node as dummy.
