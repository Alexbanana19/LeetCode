# 2.2 Return Kth to Last

# Description

Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
Hints:#8, #25, #41, #67, #126



## My Solution

### 1 Two Pointers

```python
def lastK(node, K):
    fast = slow = node
    for i in range(K):
        fast = node.next
    while fast.next is not None:
        fast = fast.next
        slow = slow.next
   return slow.next
```



## Solutions from the Book

### 1 Recursive, Time O(N), Space O(N)

By passing back an integer through the stack, we have a short solution. 

```python
def lastK(node, K):
	if node is None:
        return 0
    index = last(node.next, K) + 1
    if index == K:
        return node
    return index
```

*Note: For declarative programming language like C or Java, we can only have one data type for the return value. In this case, we need to return back the node and pass the counter by reference.
