# 5.2 Binary to String

## Description

Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print"ERROR.'



## Solutions from the Book

First, let's start off by asking ourselves what a non-integer number in binary looks like. By analogy to a decimal number, the binary number $0.101_2$ would look like:

$$0.101_2  = 1 *  1/2^1 + 0 *  1/2^2 + 1 *  1/2^3$$

To print the decimal part, we can multiply by 2 and check if 2n is greater than or equal to 1. This is essentially "shifting"the fractional sum. That is:

$$r = 2_{10} * 0.101_2 = 1.01_2$$

If r >= 1, then we know that n had a 1 right after the decimal point. By doing this continuously, we can check every digit.

```java
String printBinary(double num) {
	if (num >= 1 I I num <= 0) {
		return "ERROR";
	}
	StringBuilder binary = new StringBuilder();
	binary.append(".");
    while (num > 0){
        /* Setting a limit on length: 32 characters */
        if (binary.length() >= 32){
            return "ERROR";
        }
        double r = num * 2;
        if (r >= 1) {
            binary.append(l);
            num = r - 1;
        } else {
            binary.append(0);
            num = r;
    }
	return binary.toString();
}
```
