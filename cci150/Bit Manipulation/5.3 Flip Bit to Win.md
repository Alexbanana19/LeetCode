# 5.3 Flip Bit to Win*

## Description

You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a 0 to a 1. Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of 1s you could create.

```
EXAMPLE
Input: 1775 (or: 11011101111)
Output: 8
```

### 1 Brute Force, Time O(b), Space O(b)

One approach is to convert an integer into an array that reflects the lengths of the 0s and 1 s sequences. For example, `11011101111` would be (reading from right to left) [$0_0$, $4_1$, $1_0$, $3_1$, $1_0$, $2_1$, $21_0$]. The subscript reflects whether the integer corresponds to a 0s sequence or a 1 s sequence.

Once we have this, we just walk through the array. At each 0s sequence, then we consider merging the adjacent 1 s sequences if the 0s sequence has length 1.

```java
int longestSequence(int n) {
	if (n == -1) return Integer.BYTES * 8;
	Arraylist<Integer> sequences = getAlternatingSequences(n);
	return findLongestSequence(sequences);
}

/* Return a list of the sizes of the sequences. The sequence starts off with the number of 0s (which might be 0) and then alternates with the counts of each value.*/
Arraylist<Integer> getAlternatingSequences(int n) {
	ArrayList<Integer> sequences = new Arraylist<Integer>();
	int searchingFor = 0;
	int counter = 0;
	for (int i= 0; i <Integer.BYTES * 8; i++) {
		if ((n & 1) != searchingFor) {
			sequences.add(counter);
			searchingFor = n & 1; // Flip 1 to 0 or 0 to 1
			counter = 0;
		}
		counter++;
		n >>>= 1;
	}
	sequences.add(counter);
	return sequences;
}

/* Given the lengths of alternating sequences of 0s and ls, find the longest one we can build. */
int findlongestSequence(ArrayList<Integer> seq) {
	int maxSeq = 1;
	for (int i = 0; i < seq.size(); i += 2) {
		int zerosSeq = seq.get(i);
		int onesSeqRight = i - 1 >= 0 ? seq.get(i - 1) : 0;
		int onesSeqLeft = i + 1 < seq.size() ? seq.get(i+1) : 0 ;
		int thisSeq = 0;
		if (zerosSeq == 1) {//Can merge
			thisSeq = onesSeqLeft + 1 + onesSeqRight;
		} 
        if (zerosSeq > 1) {//Just add a zero to either side
			thisSeq = 1 + Math.max(onesSeqRight, onesSeqLeft);
		} 
        else if (zerosSeq == 0) {//No zero, but take either side
			thisSeq = Math.max(onesSeqRight, onesSeqLeft);
		}
		maxSeq = Math.max(thisSeq, maxSeq);
	}
	return maxSeq;
}
```



### 2 Optimal Solution, Time O(b), Space O(1)

To reduce the space usage, note that we don't need to hang on to the length of each sequence the entire time. We only need it long enough to compare each 1s sequence to the immediately preceding 1s sequence. 

Therefore, we can just walk through the integer doing this, tracking the current 1s sequence length and the previous 1s sequence length. When we see a zero, update previous Length: 

- If the next bit is a 1, previous Length should be set to current Length.
- If the next bit is a 0, then we can't merge these sequences together. So, set previous Length to 0.

Update max Length as we go.

```java
int flipBit(int a) {
	/* If all ls, this is already the longest sequence. */
	if (~a == 0) return Integer.BYTES * 8;
	int currentlength = 0;
	int previouslength = 0;
	int maxlength = 1; // We can always have a s equence of at least one 1
	while (a!= 0) {
		if ((a & 1) == 1) { // Current bit is a 1
			current Length++;
		} else if ((a & 1) == 0) { // Current bit is a 0
			/* Update to 0 (if next bit is 0) or currentlength (if next bit is 1). */
			previouslength = (a & 2) == 0? 0 : currentlength;
			currentLength = 0;
		}
		maxlength = Math.max(previouslength + currentlength + 1, maxlength);
		a>>>= 1;
	}
	return maxlength;
}
```
