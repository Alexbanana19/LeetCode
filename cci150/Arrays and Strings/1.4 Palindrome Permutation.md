# 1.4 Palindrome Permutation

## Description

Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
```
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
```

Hints: #106, #121, #134, #136



## My Solution

### 1 Character Count

```python
def palindromePermutation(s):
    d = {}
    for c in s:
		if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] += 1
    
    odd_count = 0
    for k, v in d.items():
    	if v % 2 != 0:
            odd_count += 1
        if odd_count > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

### 1 Character Count



### 2 Online Character Count

Same time complexity but less comparisons.

```python
def palindromePermutation(s):
    d = {}
    odd_count = 0
    for c in s:
		if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] += 1
    
    	if d[c] % 2 != 0:
            odd_count += 1
        elseï¼š
        	odd_count -= 1
            
    return odd_count <= 1
```



### 3 Bit Manipulation

If you think more deeply about this problem, you might notice that we don't actually need to know the counts. We just need to know if the count is even or odd.

Given this, we can use a single integer (as a bit vector). When we see a letter, we map it to an integer
between `0` and `26` (assuming an English alphabet). Then we toggle the bit at that value. At the end of the
iteration, we check that at most one bit in the integer is set to `1`.

```python
def palindromePermutation(s):
    checker = 0
    for c in s:
        mask = 1 << int(c)
        '''
        checker mask    checker
          0      1   ->    1
          1      0   ->    1
          1      1   ->    0
          0      0   ->    0
        '''
        
        # we can subsititue the following if-else statement with XOR:
        # checker = checker ^ mask
        
        if checker & mask == 0: 
            checker = checker | mask
        else: 
            checker = checker & ~mask
    '''
    if the count is even, then the checker = 0, simple
    if the count is odd, for example, bit(checker) = 00010000
    we know that bit(checker-1) = 00001111
    notice there's no overlap between bit(checker) and bit(checker-1)
    so checker & (checker-1) == 0
    '''
   	return checker == 0 or (checker & (checker - 1)) == 0
```
