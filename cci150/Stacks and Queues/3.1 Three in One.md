```python
class ThreeInOneStack(object):
    def __init__(self, array):
        self.array = array
        self.top = [0,1,2]
    
    def pop(self, stack_id):
        top = self.top[stack_id]
        item = self.array[top]
        self.top[stack_id] -= 3
        return data
        
    def push(self, data, stack_id):
        self.top[stack_id] += 3
        self.array[self.top[stack_id]] = data
        
    def top(self, stack_id):
        top = self.top[stack_id]
        item = self.array[top]
        return data
    
   	def isEmpty(self, stack_id):
        if self.top[stack_id] - stack_id == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```



## Solutions from the Book

We can choose either:

1. allocating a fixed amount of space for each stack, we can do that. This may mean though that one stack runs out of space, while the others are nearly empty.
2. being flexible in our space allocation, but this significantly increases the complexity of the problem.

### 1 Fixed Division

- For stack 1, we will use [0, n/3)
- For stack 1, we will use [n/3, 2n/3)
- For stack 1, we will use [2n/3, n)

In this case, we should also implement a `isFull` function to do boundary checking.



### 2. Flexible Division

A second approach is to allow the stack blocks to be flexible in size. When one stack exceeds its initial capacity, we grow the allowable capacity and shift elements as necessary.

We will also design our array to be circular, such that the final stack may start at the end of the array and wrap around to the beginning.

However, the code is far more complex to be shown in the interview.
