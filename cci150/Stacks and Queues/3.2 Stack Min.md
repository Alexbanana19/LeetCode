# 3.2 Stack Min

## Description

How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.



## My Solutions

We build an another stack to keep track of the minimum value. Each time when we are inserting/popping an element out of the main stack, we check the top element of the min stack.



## Solutions from the Book

The solution above is valid and optimal.
