# 4.1 Route Between Nodes

## Description

Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.



## My Solutions

Simple DFS or BFS can handle it.



## Solutions from the Book

It may be worth discussing with your interviewer the tradeoffs between breadth-first search and depth-first search for this and other problems. 

For example, depth-first search is a bit simpler to implement since it can be done with simple recursion. 

Breadth-first search can also be useful to find the shortest path, whereas depth-first search may traverse one adjacent node very deeply before ever going onto the immediate neighbors.
