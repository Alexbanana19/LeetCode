# 4.3 List of Depths

## Description

Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).



## My Solutions

### 1 Double Queues

```python
def buildDepthLists(node):
	que1 = [node]
    que2 = []
    d = []
    while True:
        res = None
        while len(que1) != 0:
            if node.data is not None:
                if res is None:
                    res = que1[0]
                else:
            		res.next = que1[0]
            if node.left is not None:
                que2.append(node.left)
            if node.right is not None:
                que2.append(node.right)
            del que1[0]
            node = que1[0]
        d.append(res)
        if len(que2) == 0:
        	break
        que1 = que2
        que2 = []
	return d
        
```

Same idea from the BFS solution from the book, but the implementation is less elegant.



## Solutions from the Book

### 1 DFS

We can implement a simple modification of the **pre-order** traversal algorithm, where we pass in `level + 1` to the next recursive call.

```java
void createLevelLinkedList(TreeNode root, ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> lists, int level) {
	if (root== null) return; // base case
	
    LinkedList<TreeNode> list = null;
	if (lists.size()== level) {// Level not contained in list
		list = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
    /* Levels are always traversed in order. So, if this is the 	first time we've visited level i, we must have seen levels 		0 through i - 1. We can therefore safely add the level at 	  the end. */
		lists.add(list);
	} 
    else {
		list = lists.get(level);
	}
	list.add(root);
	createLevelLinkedList(root.left, lists, level+ 1);
	createlevelLinkedList(root.right, lists, level+ 1);
}

ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> createLevelLinkedList(TreeNode root) {
	ArrayList<Linkedlist<TreeNode>> lists = new  ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>>();
	createlevellinkedlist(root, lists, 0);
	return lists;
}
```



### BFS

With each level i, we will have already fully visited all nodes on `level i - 1`. This means that to get which nodes are on `level i`, we can simply look at all children of the nodes of `level i - 1`.

```java
ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> createLevelLinkedlist(TreeNode root) {
	ArrayList<LinkedList<TreeNode>> result = new ArrayList<Linkedlist<TreeNode>>();
	/* "Visit" the root */
	LinkedList<TreeNode> current= new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
	if (root != null) {
		current.add(root);
	}
	while (current.size() > 0) {
		result.add(current); // Add previous level
		Linkedlist<TreeNode> parents = current; //Go to next level
		current = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
		for (TreeNode parent : parents) {			
			/* Visit the children*/
            if (parent.left != null) {
            	current.add(parent.left);
            }
            if (parent.right != null) {
            	current.add(parent.right);
            }
	return result;
```



## Analysis

One might ask which of these solutions is more efficient. Both run in O(N) time, but what about the space efficiency? At first, we might want to claim that the second solution is more space efficient.

In a sense, that's correct. The first solution uses O(log N) recursive calls (in a balanced tree), each of which adds a new level to the stack. The second solution, which is iterative, does not require this extra space.

However, both solutions require returning O(N) data. The extra O(log N) space usage from the recursive implementation is dwarfed by the O(N) data that must be returned. So while the first solution may actually use more data, they are equally efficient when it comes to "big O".
